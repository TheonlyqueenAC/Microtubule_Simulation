# Microtubule Simulation

### Overview
This project simulates the quantum coherence of a Gaussian wave packet in a microtubule-inspired system using Python. It models the behavior of a wave packet in a potential-free environment and visualizes the time evolution of the probability density.

---

### Features
- Simulates quantum wave packet dynamics using finite differences.
- Visualizes time evolution of the wave packet's probability density.
- Includes adjustable parameters for customization.

---

### Technologies Used
- **Python 3.9**
- **NumPy** for numerical computations.
- **Matplotlib** for visualization.

---

### Getting Started

#### Prerequisites
Ensure you have Python 3.9 or later installed on your system. Install the required dependencies:
```bash
pip install numpy matplotlib
#### Clone the Repository
git clone https://github.com/TheonlyqueenAC/Microtubule_Simulation.git
cd Microtubule_Simulation

#### Run the Simulation
python microtubule_simulation.py

Output
	•	The program generates a plot showing the wave packet’s evolution over time.
	•	The plot is also saved as quantum_coherence_evolution.png in the project directory.

Customization

You can modify the following parameters in microtubule_simulation.py:
	•	sigma: Controls the width of the wave packet.
	•	L: Adjusts the length of the spatial grid.
	•	time_steps: Sets the total number of time steps for the simulation.
