\section{Supplementary Materials}
The Supplementary Materials section provides an in-depth exploration of the computational models and simulations used in this study. Detailed algorithmic descriptions, numerical methods, and Python scripts implementing the Schr√∂dinger equation for quantum coherence evolution in microtubules are included. Additionally, it covers Fibonacci scaling integration, cytokine perturbation modeling, and event-horizon-like boundary visualization.

The code repository, available on \href{https://github.com/TheonlyqueenAC/Microtubule_Simulation}{GitHub}, contains fully annotated scripts for replicating and further developing the models. These materials offer researchers a hands-on approach to exploring the computational framework and validating its applicability to quantum biology and neuroscience.
