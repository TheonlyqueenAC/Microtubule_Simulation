\begin{abstract}
Quantum coherence, a phenomenon typically considered fragile in biological systems, is widely assumed to decohere rapidly under physiological conditions. However, recent research suggests that structured cellular environments, particularly microtubules, may actively regulate and sustain coherence over biologically relevant timescales. Tegmark \cite{tegmark_importance_2000} famously argued that quantum states in biological systems should decohere within femtoseconds, making quantum processing in the brain implausible. This study challenges this assumption by demonstrating that microtubules, when subjected to biologically realistic perturbations, exhibit structured coherence decay rather than immediate collapse. Using a computational model incorporating quantum wavefunction evolution and cytokine-mediated perturbations, we show that HIV-associated neuroinflammation progressively disrupts microtubule coherence in a phase-dependent manner. Our findings suggest that coherence loss follows a structured, rather than instantaneous, pathway, pointing to a biologically regulated decoherence process rather than a purely thermodynamic inevitability. Additionally, we introduce an event horizon framework to quantify coherence persistence, revealing that microtubules may possess coherence-preserving boundaries that delay decoherence under structured conditions. These results have implications for neuroscience, artificial intelligence, and quantum cognition, providing a testable framework for understanding how biological systems can actively regulate coherence stability. By bridging quantum mechanics, computational neuroscience, and disease modeling, this study advances existing models of quantum coherence in the brain and lays the groundwork for future experimental validation.

\section{Introduction}
\subsection{Study Overview}
Microtubules have long been hypothesized to support quantum processes within biological systems, particularly in the context of consciousness, as proposed by the Orch OR theory \cite{hameroff_orchestrated_1996,nanopoulos_quantum_1995}. Tegmark's decoherence argument \cite{tegmark_importance_2000} challenged this view, contending that quantum coherence in biological environments would collapse within femtoseconds due to thermal and molecular interactions. However, emerging research suggests that microtubules possess structural and energetic properties that may allow them to maintain coherence for significantly longer durations than previously assumed.

Experimental studies have demonstrated that tubulin contains chromophores capable of supporting long-range quantum coherence, similar to photosynthetic light
