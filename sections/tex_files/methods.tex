?\section{Methods}?

?\subsection{Mathematical Framework}?
This study uses a computational approach to simulate the evolution of quantum ?
coherence in microtubules under cytokine-induced perturbations. To explore these ?
dynamics, microtubule systems were scaled to cosmic dimensions to integrate universal ?
mathematical principles.?

?\begin{enumerate}?
?    \item \textbf{Dimensional Scaling:} The lengths, time scales, and energy levels of ?
microtubule processes were normalized using scaling constants:?
?    \begin{equation}?
?    L' = \alpha L, \quad T' = \beta T, \quad E' = \gamma E
?    \end{equation}?
?    where $\alpha$, $\beta$, and $\gamma$ were chosen to align coherence length and ?
time with astrophysical dimensions.?
?    ?
?    \item \textbf{Wavefunction Scaling:} The wavefunction's probability density was ?
logarithmically scaled:?
?    \begin{equation}?
?    \Psi' (x,t) = \log{\Psi(x,t)}?
?    \end{equation}?
?    ?
?    \item \textbf{Event Horizon Radius:} Coherence loss due to cytokine-induced ?
decoherence was expressed as:?
?    \begin{equation}?
?    R_h = \xi \cdot f(C),?
?    \end{equation}?
?    where $\xi$ is a proportional scaling factor, and $f(C)$ represents the perturbation ?
effects of cytokine concentrations.?
?\end{enumerate}?

?\subsection{Computational Algorithms}?
?\begin{enumerate}?
?    \item \textbf{Wavefunction Evolution:} Quantum state evolution was modeled using the ?
modified SchrÂšdinger equation:?
?    \begin{equation}?
?    i\hbar \frac{\partial \Psi}{\partial t} = \left[-\frac{\hbar^2}{2m}\nabla^2 + ?
V(x,t)\right]\Psi(x,t)?
?    \end{equation}?
?    where $V(x,t)$ represents the cytokine-induced potentials, and additional terms ?
incorporate decoherence effects. The finite-difference method was used for spatial and ?
temporal discretization, with boundary conditions ensuring coherence preservation at the ?
edges.?
?    ?
?    \item \textbf{Cytokine Gradient Simulation:} The cytokine diffusion equation:?
?    \begin{equation}?
?    \frac{\partial C}{\partial t} = D \nabla^2 C - \lambda C
?    \end{equation}?
?    was solved numerically, where $D$ is the cytokine diffusion coefficient, and $\lambda$ ?
represents the degradation rate.?
?\end{enumerate}?

?\subsection{Visualizations}?
Dynamic visual outputs were generated to illustrate quantum coherence and event ?
horizon-like boundaries within the microtubule lattice. Specific scripts from the GitHub ?
repository (e.g., \texttt{microtubule_coherence_simulation.py}, ?
?\texttt{fibonacci_wavefunction_evolution.py}, \texttt{cylindrical_geo_microtubule.py}, ?
?\texttt{two_dimensional_wavefunction_cylinder.py}, ?
?\texttt{cytokine_event_horizon_overlay.py} and ?
?\texttt{wavefunction_cytokine_cosmic_scaled.py}) were used to produce 1D and 2D plots.?
