\section{Supplementary}
The Supplementary Materials section provides an in-depth exploration of the computational models and simulations used in this study. Detailed algorithmic descriptions, numerical methods, and Python scripts that implement the Schrodinger equation for quantum coherence evolution in microtubules are included. In addition, it includes Fibonacci scaling integration, cytokine perturbation modeling, and event-horizon-like boundary visualization. The code repository, available on \href{https://github.com/TheonlyqueenAC/Microtubule_Simulation/blob/1d74de4518e8c77e6b1fe4699c4b0ee10ae22051/script},{Github}:\url{https://github.com/TheonlyqueenAC/Microtubule_Simulation/blob/1d74de4518e8c77e6b1fe4699c4b0ee10ae22051/script}, contains annotated scripts for replication and further development of the models. These materials offer researchers a hands-on approach to exploring the computational framework and validating its applicability to quantum biology and neuroscience.
