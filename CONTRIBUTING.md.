### **Demo Video Tips**

#### Script for Demo:
1. **Introduction**:
   - “Welcome to the Microtubule Simulation project! In this video, I’ll walk you through the setup, execution, and output of this simulation.”

2. **Setup**:
   - Show cloning the repository and installing dependencies:
     ```bash
     git clone https://github.com/TheonlyqueenAC/Microtubule_Simulation.git
     cd Microtubule_Simulation
     pip install numpy matplotlib
     ```

3. **Running the Simulation**:
   - Show running the script:
     ```bash
     python microtubule_simulation.py
     ```
   - Explain the plot that gets generated (e.g., "This graph shows the evolution of the wave packet's probability density over time").

4. **Customization**:
   - Highlight modifiable parameters in the code and demonstrate their effects.

5. **Closing**:
   - “Thank you for watching! Feel free to contribute to the project or share your feedback.”
