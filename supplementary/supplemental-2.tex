\subsection{Mathematical Derivations}

\subsubsection{Scaling Constants}

The mathematical framework for scaling microtubule dimensions to cosmic scales relies on the following transformations:
\[
L_{\text{scaled}} = L_{\text{microtubule}} \cdot k_L, \quad
\]
where \(k_L\) represents the length scaling constant, determined to align the coherence length with astrophysical event horizon radii.

For temporal and energy scaling:
\[
\begin{aligned}
t_{\text{scaled}} &= t_{\text{microtubule}} \cdot k_T, \\
E_{\text{scaled}} &= E_{\text{microtubule}} \cdot k_E
\end{aligned}
\]
\(k_T\) and \(k_E\) were selected to preserve the dynamics of coherence and decoherence.

Probability density scaling was performed logarithmically to manage large dynamic ranges:
\[
|\Psi|^2_{\text{scaled}} = \log(|\Psi|^2_{\text{microtubule}}).
\]

\subsubsection{Event Horizon Radius}

The coherence loss under cytokine-induced decoherence is expressed using:
\[
r_h = \frac{1}{1 + \frac{\text{mean}(\Gamma_{\text{cytokine}})}{k}},
\]
where \(k\) is a proportional scaling factor. The radius quantifies localized quantum coherence boundaries analogous to astrophysical event horizons.

\subsection{Computational Algorithms}

\subsubsection{Wavefunction Evolution}

The evolution of the Gaussian wave packet was simulated using the modified Schr\"odinger equation:
\[
i\hbar \frac{\partial \Psi}{\partial t} = -\frac{\hbar^2}{2m} \nabla^2 \Psi + V_{\text{cytokine}}(r, z, t) \Psi - \Gamma_{\text{cytokine}}(r, z, t) \Psi,
\]
where:
- \(V_{\text{cytokine}}(r, z, t)\) models spatially and temporally varying cytokine-induced potentials.
- \(\Gamma_{\text{cytokine}}(r, z, t)\) introduces decoherence terms.

Finite-difference methods were implemented for spatial and temporal discretization, with boundary conditions enforcing coherence preservation at the edges.

\subsubsection{Cytokine Gradient Simulation}

The cytokine diffusion equation:
\[
\frac{\partial C(r, z, t)}{\partial t} = D_c \nabla^2 C - \kappa_c C
\]
was solved numerically, where:
- \(D_c\) is the cytokine diffusion coefficient.
- \(\kappa_c\) represents the cytokine degradation rate.
